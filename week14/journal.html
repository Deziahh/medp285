        <h2>Personal Portfolio Update</h2>
        <h4>DEC.18.24</h4>
        <p>I have finally added finishing touches on my personal website for now and I am going to start linking this site on future job applications. In the future I want to add more creative elements to the site that reflect who I am. I was thinking hand drawn graphics or gifs to go around the border of the page, because I usually doodle when I'm writing on paper. <br> <br> I was also recently accepted into CUNY's Inclusize Economy program at Hunter's Film and Media Studies department. This acceptance comes with mentoring, internship and job placements, and career development support.</p>

        <h2>Major Change</h2>
        <h4>NOV.22.24</h4>
        <p>My major has officially changed from Computer Science to Emerging Media and my Spring 2025 classes reflect this change. I am taking intro classes to lean more into game development as well as UI/UX development. Here is a list of the courses I'll be taking next semester: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Intro to 2D Animation</li>
                <li>Programming Methods</li>
                <li>Intermediate Spanish</li>
                <li>Understanding New Media</li>
                <li>Digital Design and Usability</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Upcoming Project</h2>
        <h4>NOV.17.24</h4>
        <p>I am working on a new project for my Histories and Theories of Animaions class. The professor orginally asked for a 10-page paper expounding on an animated film and doing a film comparison with another film on the syllubus, but I've asked to do a creative alternative. I am looking to do a p5.js sketch based on <i>Epic</i>. I am hoping for the sketch to be creative and interactive, as I will explore concepts and animations from the film while incorporating similar elements into the design. The sketch will include an analysis of key sequences, such as the climactic battle for the forest, and will provide side-by-side comparisons with scenes from Toy Story that use similar visual techniques. <br> <br> Please be on the lookout to see how this idea comes to life!
